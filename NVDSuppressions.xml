      cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c in file through 5.37 does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write)
    This is a false positive in cdf.c which is not used by PKS

      readelf.c in file before 5.22, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5, does not consider that pread calls sometimes read only a subset of the available data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file.
     This is a false positive in readelf.c as PKS is not using this, or PHP.

      8117-softmagic.c in file before 5.21 does not properly limit recursion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) via unspecified vectors.
      9652-The mconvert function in softmagic.c in file before 5.21, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5, does not properly handle a certain string-length field during a copy of a truncated version of a Pascal string, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and application crash) via a crafted file.
    This is a false positive. These two CVEs references a C library softmagic.c which is not used by PKS

		3479-The cdf_check_stream_offset function in cdf.c in file before 5.19, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14, relies on incorrect sector-size data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted stream offset in a CDF file.
